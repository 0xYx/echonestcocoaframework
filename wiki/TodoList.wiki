= Documentation =
  
  * For the time being, we use a good old commenting that is difficult to track. We need to improve commenting and documentation (i.e : doxygen) 

= Missing methods =

  * All the Artist methods.
  * Charts methods.
  * Identifer methods.

= Improvements =

  * Better error handling (almost inexistent now).
  * Change the XML parsing method to use NSXMLParser for iPhone portability.
  * Refine returned results, using NSDictionnary or NSArray.
  * Another notification mode. We are using NSNotification. Maybe we need to implement a delegate protocol.
  * Find a way to update upload status (percentage) for the MP3 uploading method.
